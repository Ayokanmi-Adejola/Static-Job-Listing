### Key features

🔧 **Dynamic Content Rendering**
```js
// Creates job cards from data
function createJobCard(job) {
  const jobCard = document.createElement('div');
  jobCard.className = `job-card ${job.featured ? 'featured' : ''}`;
  // Dynamic HTML generation with proper data attributes
}
```

🎯 **Smart Filtering System**
```js
// Multi-filter logic with AND operation
function filterJobs() {
  const filteredJobs = jobsData.filter(job => {
    const jobTags = [job.role, job.level, ...job.languages, ...job.tools]
      .map(tag => tag.toLowerCase());
    return activeFilters.every(filter => jobTags.includes(filter));
  });
}
```

📱 **Responsive CSS Architecture**
```css
/* Mobile-first approach */
.job-card { /* Mobile styles */ }

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .job-card {
    flex-direction: column;
    /* Mobile-specific adjustments */
  }
}
```
